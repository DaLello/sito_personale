<h1>About me and this site</h1>
<p class="about_me" value="2"> <i>Doch eben, die Menschen tr√§umen nicht nur nachts, durchaus nicht.</i><br />
Ernst Bloch, <i>Das Prinzip Hoffnung</i>, Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt 1979, p. 96.</p>
<p>This site is a small personal experiment: never knew how to programme, decided to do it. The project started on 20 January 2025.
For now, programming is to me like learning to talk to a rather stupid and obtuse individual who needs to believe that language has only one meaning and that it is unambiguous.
Perhaps a system who does not feel the rhythm, the continuum? I still have to mull this over a bit.
Nonetheless, for now it seems entertaining.</p>

<h2>Education?</h2>
<p>
<i>People learn that they acquire more value in the market if they spend more hours in class. They learn to value progressive consumption of curricula.
They learn that whatever a major institution produces has value, even invisible things such as education or health. They learn to value grade advancement,
passive submission, and even the standard misbehavior that teachers like to interpret as a sign of creativity. They learn disciplined competition for the favor of the bureaucrat who
presides over their daily sessions, who is called their teacher as long as they are in class and their boss when they go to work. They learn to define themselves as holders of knowledge stock in the specialty in which they have made investments of their time.
They learn to accept their place in society precisely in the class and career corresponding to the level at which they leave school and to the field of their academic specialization.</i><br />
